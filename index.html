        <h1>Marine Litter Watch: Litter on the beach</h1>
        <p>The problem of ocean garbage is becoming more and more serious. Some people have made a lot of contributions to people's environment quietly. </p>
        <p>They organize the cleaning of beach rubbish without expecting anything in return and deserve everyone's respect.</p>

                <h2>Map of Events</h2>
                <p>This interactive map shows the beaches and the litter collection events organised by the Marine LitterWatch communities.</p>
                <p>Through this map, we can see that the vast majority of beach cleaning activity is focused on Europe.</p>
                <p>That's because thereâ€™s a European APP that encourages people to voluntarily clean up or monitor beach litter.</p>
                <p>At the bottom of the map, you can try zooming in and out to see all the activity from 2015 to 2021.</p>
                <p>(When clicking on a beach, the data of each event will be shown)</p>

            <h3>Community Activity</h3>
            <p>This graph shows the activity of each community by number of events carried out each year.</p>
            <p>We can see from this graph that in 2020, the total number of community activities is the lowest of all years. </p>
            <p>We can speculate that this is the cause of the COVID-19, people have reduced their beach cleaning activities. </p>

            <h2>Overview of Results</h2>
            <p>The following two graphs are the overview of the distribution of collected litter items by material and the top 10 items.</p>
            <p>We can find that among all the categories, plastic accounts for the most.</p>
            <p>(When clicking on the graph, the data of event will be shown)</p>
            <div id="bar_chart"></div>>
            <p>Among all the items, cigarette butts and filters account for the most.</p>
            <p>If we can, we should use less plastic, cut back on cigarettes and filters.</p>
